- arm: `shot`
- probes: whether a `display: none` box still occupies space in the flow
- expected: NO — `display: none` removes the box from the flow entirely, so `root>third` starts at y=40

## Question

`root>gone` sits between `root>first` and `root>third` and is `display: none`. Is there a 40px vertical gap between `root>first` and `root>third` where it would have been?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root        div
root>first  div  "first"
root>gone   div  "gone"
root>third  div  "third"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.

## Model reply

The `display: none` property removes an element from the document flow, meaning it occupies no space in the layout. The screenshot confirms this, showing "third" rendered immediately below "first" without the large vertical gap that would be present if `root>gone` still occupied its 40px space.

ANSWER: NO
