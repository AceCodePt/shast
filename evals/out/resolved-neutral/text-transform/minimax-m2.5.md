## Question

Exactly what characters does a viewer see inside `root>title`?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 500x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root        div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=500 height=19.19
  = text-transform: uppercase

root>title  div  "ANNUAL REVIEW"  (written "Annual review")
  @ x=0 y=0 width=500 height=19.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited)
```

## Model reply

The source text inside `root>title` is "Annual review", but the element has `text-transform: uppercase` applied via inheritance from `root`. This CSS property converts all letters to uppercase regardless of how they were written in the markup.

ANSWER: ANNUAL REVIEW
