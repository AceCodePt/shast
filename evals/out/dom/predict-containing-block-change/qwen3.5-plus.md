# predict-containing-block-change — opencode/qwen3.5-plus

- arm: `dom`
- probes: the geometry that results from an edit, given only the page before it
- expected: 30,30 — `root>plain` becomes the containing block, so the 10px offsets are measured from its padding edge at 20,20 instead of the root's at 0,0
- parsed answer: `30,30`
- verdict: **PASS**

## Question

After that edit, at what x,y does the top-left corner of `root>plain>pin` render?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root            div
root>plain      div
root>plain>pin  div  "pinned"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=600 height=100
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 100px
  left: 0px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: relative
  top: 0px
  width: 600px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 20px 20px 20px 20px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>plain <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=20 y=20 width=560 height=60
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 60px
  left: auto
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  top: auto
  width: 560px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 30px 30px 30px 30px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>plain>pin <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=10 y=10 width=80 height=20
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 20px
  left: 10px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: absolute
  top: 10px
  width: 80px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

The evidence above is the page exactly as it stands. Consider adding `position: relative` to `root>plain`'s css block. You are not shown a rendering of the outcome — work it out from the evidence.

## Model reply

Currently, `root>plain>pin` has `position: absolute` but its parent `root>plain` has `position: static`. This means the pinned element's containing block is `root` (the nearest positioned ancestor), so its `top: 10px; left: 10px` offsets it from `root`'s top-left at (0, 0), resulting in the current position of (10, 10).

After adding `position: relative` to `root>plain`, that element becomes the containing block for the absolutely positioned `pin`. The `root>plain` element's bounding box starts at (20, 20) in the viewport. The `pin` element's `top: 10px; left: 10px` will now offset it from `root>plain`'s top-left corner.

Therefore: x = 20 + 10 = 30, y = 20 + 10 = 30

ANSWER: 30,30
