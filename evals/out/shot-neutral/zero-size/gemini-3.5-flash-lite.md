# zero-size — opencode/gemini-3.5-flash-lite

- arm: `shot`
- probes: a node that renders at no size while carrying content

## Question

`root>ghost` renders at 0x0. Are the words "Important warning" nevertheless painted somewhere on the page?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root          div
root>ghost    div  "Important warning"
root>visible  div  "Everything is fine"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 400x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

Although `root>ghost` renders at 0x0, both the rendered screenshot and the visual evidence show that the word "warning" from "Important warning" is painted on the page.

ANSWER: YES
