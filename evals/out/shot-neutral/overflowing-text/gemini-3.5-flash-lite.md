## Question

Does all of `root>card`'s text fit inside `root>card`'s own 48px-tall border box?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root       div
root>card  div  "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month."

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 400x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

The rendered screenshot and node tree show that only the first two lines of the text are contained within the `root>card` border box, while the remaining lines overflow outside its bottom edge. Therefore, not all of the text fits inside the box.

ANSWER: NO
