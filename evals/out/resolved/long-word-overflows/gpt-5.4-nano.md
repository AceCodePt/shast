# long-word-overflows — opencode/gpt-5.4-nano

- arm: `resolved`
- probes: an unbreakable token wider than its box
- expected: NO — there is no break opportunity in the URL, so the single word runs to ~518px and is painted outside the box

## Question

Does the URL in `root>cell` stay inside `root>cell`'s 120px-wide box?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 600x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root       div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=19.19

root>cell  div  "https://example.com/a/very/long/path/that/never/breaks"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=120 height=19.19  overflows
  = width: 120px, font-size: 16px
  ! overflows: content is 518.41x19.19px inside a 120x19.19px content box, so it is painted outside the box rather than cut off (overflow is visible)
```

## Model reply

The report shows `root>cell` has a measured box of `width=120px` and is marked `overflows`, meaning the content’s measured size is `518.41x19.19px`, which is far wider than the 120px container. It also explicitly states that overflow is visible and that the URL is painted outside the box rather than cut off. Therefore, the URL does not stay inside the 120px-wide box.

ANSWER: NO
