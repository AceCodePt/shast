## Question

Can a viewer read the words in `root>line`? Note that neither covering box on its own spans the whole line.

## Context shown to the model

The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root            div
root>line       div  "Hidden by two"
root>leftHalf   div
root>rightHalf  div

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

## Model reply

Looking at the information provided:

The `root>line` div contains the text "Hidden by two" and has dimensions of 400x300 (full width).

Two absolutely positioned boxes are covering it:
- `leftHalf`: positioned at x=0, width=70px (covers left portion)
- `rightHalf`: positioned at x=60, width=80px (covers from x=60 to x=140)

These boxes overlap in the range x=60-70px, but leave a gap uncovered between x=70-60px... wait, that's backwards. Let me recalculate:
- `leftHalf` covers x=0 to x=70
- `rightHalf` covers x=60 to x=140 (60+80)

They overlap from x=60-70, and together they cover x=0 to x=140. The text "Hidden by two" spans the full 400px width, so the region from x=140 to x=400 remains visible and uncovered.

However, the question asks if a viewer can "read the words" - meaning understand the text content. Since the boxes only cover the leftmost 140px of the 400px-wide line, and the text extends across the full width, a viewer can see a significant portion of the text that isn't covered by either box.

ANSWER: YES
