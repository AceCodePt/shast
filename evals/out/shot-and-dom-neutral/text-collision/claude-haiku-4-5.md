## Question

Which node's text is drawn on the same pixels as `root>ghost`'s text?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root          div
root>ghost    div  "Important warning"
root>visible  div  "Everything is fine"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 19.1875px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 400px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>ghost <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=0 height=0
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 0px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 0px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>visible <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 19.1875px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 400px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

## Model reply

Looking at the browser data provided:

The `root>ghost` node has dimensions of `width=0 height=0` (0 pixels), meaning it occupies no space on the screen and its text cannot be rendered or drawn at all.

The `root>visible` node occupies the same position (`x=0 y=0`) and has the same dimensions as the root (`width=400 height=19.1875`). The screenshot shows "Everything is fine" is visible at the top of the page, which corresponds to the `root>visible` node.

Since `root>ghost` has zero dimensions, its text is not actually drawn on any pixels. However, if we interpret the question as asking which node's text appears in the same visual space where `root>ghost`'s text would theoretically be (had it been rendered), that would be `root>visible`, which occupies the exact same bounding box position and overlaps completely with where the ghost element would be.

ANSWER: root>visible
