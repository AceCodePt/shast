## Question

Which renders with larger text, `root>heading` or `root>caption`?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root          div
root>heading  div  "Quarterly report"
root>caption  div  "Draft"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 500x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

Visually, the text "Quarterly report" occupies a much larger vertical space and has a greater font size than the text "Draft" below it. According to the provided node tree, "Quarterly report" corresponds to the `root>heading` node and "Draft" corresponds to the `root>caption` node.

ANSWER: root>heading
