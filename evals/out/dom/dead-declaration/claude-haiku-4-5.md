# dead-declaration — opencode/claude-haiku-4-5

- arm: `dom`
- probes: an own declaration that an ancestor overrides, i.e. a shadowed property
- expected: NO — the root's `> body > panel` block overrides it with 4px

## Question

`root>body>panel` has `padding: 32px` in its own css block. Does that declaration have any effect on the rendered page?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x300

root             div
root>body        div
root>body>panel  section  "Panel"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-radius: 0px
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

## Model reply

Looking at the browser's computed style data for `root>body>panel`, the element shows `padding: 4px 4px 4px 4px` in its actual rendered state.

If the CSS block declares `padding: 32px`, but the computed style shows `4px` on all sides, this indicates that the `32px` declaration is being overridden by another CSS rule with higher specificity. The declaration exists in the CSS but is not producing its intended effect - instead, a different padding value (4px) is being applied.

Therefore, the `padding: 32px` declaration does not have any effect on the rendered page, since it is being superseded by a competing CSS rule.
