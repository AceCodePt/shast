## Question

`root` is `display: grid` with `grid-template-columns: 200px 300px` and `gap: 20px`. At what x does `root>right`'s left edge render?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 600x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root        div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=19.19
  = display: grid, grid-template-columns: 200px 300px, gap: 20px

root>left   div  "left"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=200 height=19.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited)

root>right  div  "right"
  @ x=220 y=0 width=300 height=19.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited)
```

## Model reply

Based on the layout report, the `root` element uses a CSS grid with a first column width of 200px and a gap of 20px. The second column (`root>right`) begins immediately after the first column and its 20px gap, placing its left edge at x = 200 + 20 = 220. This is also explicitly confirmed by the measured border box coordinates (`@ x=220`) in the report.

ANSWER: 220
