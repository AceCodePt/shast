## Question

All three boxes overlap the point 120,120. Which one does a viewer actually see at that point?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x400

root         div
root>back    div
root>middle  div
root>front   div

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 500x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

At a point where all three boxes overlap, the one painted last is on top. With no other stacking rules given, the DOM order controls painting, so `root>front` is above `root>middle`, which is above `root>back`.

ANSWER: root>front
