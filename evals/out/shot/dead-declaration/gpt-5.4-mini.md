# dead-declaration — opencode/gpt-5.4-mini

- arm: `shot`
- probes: an own declaration that an ancestor overrides, i.e. a shadowed property

## Question

`root>body>panel` has `padding: 32px` in its own css block. Does that declaration have any effect on the rendered page?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x300

root             div
root>body        div
root>body>panel  section  "Panel"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

No visible effect is shown. If `padding: 32px` were taking effect on that `section`, the `Panel` text would be inset from the top-left by about 32px, but the screenshot shows it flush to the corner. So, based on the rendered result, that declaration does not affect the page.

ANSWER: NO
