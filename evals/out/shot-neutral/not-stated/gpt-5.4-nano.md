## Question

What text colour does `root>label` render with? If the report does not contain that information, say so rather than guessing.

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root        div
root>label  div  "Total due"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 400x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

The report’s authoritative Chromium node tree includes the text content (“Total due”) and the viewport/layout, but it does not provide any computed styles such as the text color for `root>label`. Since no color information is stated anywhere in the given excerpt, we can’t determine the rendered text color from this report alone.

ANSWER: NOT STATED
