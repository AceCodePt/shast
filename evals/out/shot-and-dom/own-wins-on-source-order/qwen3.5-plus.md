## Question

Three different blocks declare `padding` for `root>child`. What padding does it actually render with?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root        div
root>child  div  "Child"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=147.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>child <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=147.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 64px 64px 64px 64px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 500x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.

## Model reply

The browser data for `root>child` shows the computed style directly from `getComputedStyle()`. The padding property is listed as `64px 64px 64px 64px`, meaning 64px on all four sides. This is the actual rendered value after CSS cascade and inheritance resolved any competing declarations.

ANSWER: 64px
