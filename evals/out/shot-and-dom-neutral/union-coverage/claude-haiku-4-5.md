## Question

Can a viewer read the words in `root>line`? Note that neither covering box on its own spans the whole line.

## Context shown to the model

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root            div
root>line       div  "Hidden by two"
root>leftHalf   div
root>rightHalf  div

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

## Model reply

Looking at the information provided:

The `root>line` div contains the text "Hidden by two" and spans the full width of 400px (from x=0 to x=400) at y=0 with height 19.1875px.

The two covering boxes are:
- `leftHalf`: x=0, width=70px (covers 0-70px)
- `rightHalf`: x=60, width=80px (covers 60-140px)

These boxes overlap in the range 60-70px, but they leave a gap between x=70 and x=60... wait, that's incorrect. Let me reconsider: rightHalf starts at x=60, so the coverage is actually 0-70px (leftHalf) and 60-140px (rightHalf), meaning x=70-140px is covered by rightHalf. The text spans 0-400px, so the region from x=140-400px is completely uncovered and visible.

However, the question asks if a viewer can read the words. While part of the line (from x=140 onwards) is visible, the leftmost portion of the text "Hidden by two" is obscured by the two boxes covering the 0-140px range. Since a significant portion of the text at the beginning is hidden, a viewer cannot read the complete words.

ANSWER: NO
