## Question

Does all of `root>card`'s text fit inside `root>card`'s own 48px-tall border box?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 400x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root       div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=48

root>card  div  "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month."
  @ x=0 y=0 width=180 height=48  wrapped overflows
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), width: 180px, height: 48px, padding: 8px, border-width: 1px, border-style: solid
  ! wrapped: text broke onto 4 lines at 162px content width
  ! overflows: content is 153.61x76.75px inside a 162x30px content box, so it is painted outside the box rather than cut off (overflow is visible)
```

## Model reply

The `root>card` has a total border box height of 48px. However, after accounting for 8px padding and 1px border on the top and bottom, the internal content box height is only 30px. The report explicitly states that the text content measures 76.75px in height and overflows the box, meaning it extends well beyond the 48px border box.

ANSWER: NO
