## Question

The four boxes form a two-by-two arrangement. Which node sits directly to the right of `root>leftBottom`, on the same row?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 800x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root              div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=800 height=300
  = position: relative, height: 300px

root>leftTop      div  "left top"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=300 height=80
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 0px, left: 0px, width: 300px, height: 80px

root>rightTop     div  "right top"
  @ x=340 y=0 width=300 height=80
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 0px, left: 340px, width: 300px, height: 80px

root>leftBottom   div  "left bottom"
  @ x=0 y=120 width=300 height=80
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 120px, left: 0px, width: 300px, height: 80px

root>rightBottom  div  "right bottom"
  @ x=340 y=120 width=300 height=80
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 120px, left: 340px, width: 300px, height: 80px
```

## Model reply

`root>leftBottom` is positioned at y=120 with an x-coordinate of 0. Looking at the other boxes on the same row (y=120), `root>rightBottom` is located at x=340, placing it directly to the right.

ANSWER: root>rightBottom
