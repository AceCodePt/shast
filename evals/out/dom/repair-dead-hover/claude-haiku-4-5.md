# repair-dead-hover — opencode/claude-haiku-4-5

- arm: `dom`
- probes: naming the block that is killing a state, not the state's own block
- expected: root — its `> mid > leaf` block is (0,3,0) and outranks the leaf's own `:hover` at (0,2,0), so the hover is dead until the root's block changes
- parsed answer: ``root>mid`

## Question

You want `root>mid>leaf` to grow to 40px of padding on hover. Which node's css block do you have to edit to get it?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root           div
root>mid       div
root>mid>leaf  div  "Leaf"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid>leaf <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

Then the same data again while the mouse hovers `root>mid>leaf` — compare the two for what the `:hover` state changes:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid>leaf <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

The evidence above is the page exactly as it stands. Consider that `:hover { padding: 40px }` has already been added to `root>mid>leaf`'s own css block — it is there in the source — and hovering changes nothing. You are not shown a rendering of the outcome — work it out from the evidence.

## Model reply

Looking at the evidence provided:

1. The CSS rule `:hover { padding: 40px }` is already in `root>mid>leaf`'s own css block (as stated in the problem)
2. When hovering over `root>mid>leaf`, the computed styles show no change—padding remains `2px 2px 2px 2px`
3. This means the hover rule is not being applied to `root>mid>leaf` itself

The issue is that `:hover` selectors only work when applied to the element being hovered. Since `root>mid>leaf` has `:hover` defined in its own block, it should respond when that element is hovered. However, the padding isn't changing.

The solution is to apply the padding rule to a **parent element** using a child selector. The `:hover` pseudo-class on `root>mid>leaf` targets only when that specific element is hovered, but if we want the visual effect to be visible, we need to modify the parent (`root>mid`) to have a rule that applies when its child is hovered: `root>mid leaf:hover { padding: 40px }`.

Since we need to edit a css block to make the hover effect work, and the parent element can apply styling to the hovered child, we need to edit the parent's css block.

ANSWER: `root>mid`
