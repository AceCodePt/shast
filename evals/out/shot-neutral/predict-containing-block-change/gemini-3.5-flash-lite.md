# predict-containing-block-change — opencode/gemini-3.5-flash-lite

- arm: `shot`
- probes: the geometry that results from an edit, given only the page before it
- expected: 30,30 — `root>plain` becomes the containing block, so the 10px offsets are measured from its padding edge at 20,20 instead of the root's at 0,0

## Question

After that edit, at what x,y does the top-left corner of `root>plain>pin` render?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root            div
root>plain      div
root>plain>pin  div  "pinned"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.

The evidence above is the page exactly as it stands. Consider adding `position: relative` to `root>plain`'s css block. You are not shown a rendering of the outcome — work it out from the evidence.
```

## Model reply

Adding `position: relative` to `root>plain` establishes it as the containing block for the descendant element `root>plain>pin`. Since `root>plain` is positioned at the top-left corner of the layout with no margins, padding, or offsets, the absolute positioning of `pin` relative to its new containing block remains unchanged. Therefore, `root>plain>pin` continues to render at the origin.
