# zero-size — opencode/glm-5

- arm: `resolved`
- probes: a node that renders at no size while carrying content

## Question

`root>ghost` renders at 0x0. Are the words "Important warning" nevertheless painted somewhere on the page?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 400x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root          div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.19

root>ghost    div  "Important warning"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=0 height=0  wrapped overflows zero collides
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), height: 0px, width: 0px
  ! wrapped: text broke onto 2 lines at 0px content width
  ! overflows: content is 86.41x38.38px inside a 0x0px content box, so it is painted outside the box rather than cut off (overflow is visible)
  ! zero: 0x0px
  ! collides: root>visible <div> draws its text on the same pixels, over 56% of this node's glyphs

root>visible  div  "Everything is fine"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.19  collides
  = font-size: 16px (inherited)
  ! collides: root>ghost <div> draws its text on the same pixels, over 50% of this node's glyphs
```

## Model reply

Yes. Although `root>ghost` is a 0x0 box, its overflow is visible, so its content (86.41x38.38px of text) is painted outside the box rather than being clipped. The report's `collides` annotation confirms the ghost's glyphs are actually drawn on the page — they land on the same pixels as `root>visible`'s "Everything is fine" text, which is why they collide.

ANSWER: YES
