# zero-size — opencode/gpt-5.4-mini

## Question

`root>ghost` renders at 0x0. Are the words "Important warning" nevertheless painted somewhere on the page?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root          div
root>ghost    div  "Important warning"
root>visible  div  "Everything is fine"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 400x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

Yes. The screenshot shows `Important warning` painted at the top-left of the page, even though `root>ghost` has a 0x0 box. Since the rendered image is authoritative, the text is visibly present on screen.

ANSWER: YES
