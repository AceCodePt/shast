## Question

Is `root>footer` inside the area the viewer sees when the page first loads, before any scrolling?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root         div
root>top     div  "masthead"
root>footer  div  "footer note"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 500x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

No. The screenshot of the 500x300 viewport shows only `masthead`; `footer note` is not visible in the initial rendered area, so `root>footer` is below the fold before scrolling.

ANSWER: NO
