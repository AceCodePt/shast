## Question

Which renders with larger text, `root>heading` or `root>caption`?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 500x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root          div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=500 height=62.39
  = font-size: 30px

root>heading  div  "Quarterly report"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=500 height=36
  = font-size: 30px (inherited)

root>caption  div  "Draft"
  @ x=0 y=36 width=500 height=26.39
  = font-size: 22px
```

## Model reply

`root>heading` renders with larger text because its computed (and inherited) `font-size` is **30px**, while `root>caption` has a smaller `font-size` of **22px**. The layout boxes and heights are consistent with that: the heading occupies 36px height, whereas the caption occupies 26.39px.

ANSWER: root>heading
