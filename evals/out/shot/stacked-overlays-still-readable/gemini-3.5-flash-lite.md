## Question

Two boxes paint over `root>line`. Can a viewer still read its text?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root        div
root>line   div  "Still readable"
root>glass  div
root>panel  div

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 400x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

Based on the provided screenshot and node tree information, the text "Still readable" is clearly visible and legible at the top of the viewport above the dark overlay element. A viewer can easily read the text despite the boxes rendered below or around it.

ANSWER: YES
