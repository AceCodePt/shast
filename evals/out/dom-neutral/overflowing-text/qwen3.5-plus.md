## Question

Does all of `root>card`'s text fit inside `root>card`'s own 48px-tall border box?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root       div
root>card  div  "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month."

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=48
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-style: solid
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 48px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 400px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>card <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=180 height=48
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-style: solid
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 48px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 180px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 8px 8px 8px 8px
  border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px
```

## Model reply

Looking at the data:

`root>card` has a height of 48px with 8px padding on top and bottom, plus 1px border on top and bottom. This leaves a content box height of: 48 - 16 (padding) - 2 (borders) = **30px** for content.

The text "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month." is 62 characters. With a 16px font-size and 180px width (162px content width after padding/borders), the text would wrap to approximately 3-4 lines. At 19.2px line-height, 3-4 lines need **57.6-76.8px** of vertical space.

Since 57.6-76.8px > 30px available content height, the text cannot fit within the border box.

ANSWER: NO
