# zero-size — opencode/gemini-3.5-flash-lite

## Question

`root>ghost` renders at 0x0. Are the words "Important warning" nevertheless painted somewhere on the page?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 400x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root          div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.19

root>ghost    div  "Important warning"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=0 height=0  wrapped overflows zero collides
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), height: 0px, width: 0px
  ! wrapped: text broke onto 2 lines at 0px content width
  ! overflows: content is 86.41x38.38px inside a 0x0px content box, so it is painted outside the box rather than cut off (overflow is visible)
  ! zero: 0x0px
  ! collides: root>visible <div> draws its text on the same pixels, over 56% of this node's glyphs

root>visible  div  "Everything is fine"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.19  collides
  = font-size: 16px (inherited)
  ! collides: root>ghost <div> draws its text on the same pixels, over 50% of this node's glyphs
```

## Model reply

Yes, the text "Important warning" is painted on the page despite the element rendering at 0x0. As noted in the overflow explanation, the content box is 0x0 but the content is 86.41x38.38px and is painted outside the box rather than cut off because overflow is visible. Additionally, it collides with `root>visible` by drawing its text on the same pixels.

ANSWER: YES
