- probes: a fixed box resolving against the viewport, not a positioned ancestor
- expected: 25,15 — a fixed box resolves against the viewport, so the positioned parent and its padding are both ignored

## Question

`root` is `position: relative` with 40px of padding, and `root>inner` is `position: fixed` with `top: 15px; left: 25px`. At what x,y does the top-left corner of `root>inner` render?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root        div
root>inner  div  "fixed"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.

## Model reply

Because `root>inner` is `position: fixed`, it is positioned relative to the viewport, not relative to the `root` element’s `position: relative` padding box. The `top: 15px` and `left: 25px` therefore place the top-left corner of `root>inner` at x=25 and y=15 in CSS pixels.

ANSWER: 25,15
