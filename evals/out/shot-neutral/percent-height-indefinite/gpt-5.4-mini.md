# percent-height-indefinite — opencode/gpt-5.4-mini

- arm: `shot`
- probes: a percentage height whose containing block is indefinite
- expected: NO — `root>outer` has no declared height, so the percentage behaves as `auto` and `tall` is one line (~19px) against `filler`'s 60px
- parsed answer: `NO`

## Question

`root>outer>tall` declares `height: 100%`. Is it taller than its sibling `root>outer>filler`?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root               div
root>outer         div
root>outer>filler  div  "a"
root>outer>tall    div  "b"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

`height: 100%` only makes `tall` fill its containing block if that container has a definite height. From the rendered page, `root>outer` does not appear to have a definite height, so `tall` ends up sizing to its content rather than becoming taller than `filler`. The screenshot also shows both items as simple single-line boxes with no extra vertical expansion on `tall`.

ANSWER: NO
