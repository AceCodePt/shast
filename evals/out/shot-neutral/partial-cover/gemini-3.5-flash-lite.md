## Question

`root>chip` paints over part of `root>row`. Is any of `root>row`'s own text hidden by it?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root       div
root>row   p    "Short label"
root>chip  div  "chip"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

The text "Short label" from `root>row` is positioned on the top left, while the yellow box `root>chip` containing "chip" is located on the top right. Inspection of the screenshot and layout shows that `root>chip` does not overlap or cover any portion of `root>row`'s text.

ANSWER: NO
