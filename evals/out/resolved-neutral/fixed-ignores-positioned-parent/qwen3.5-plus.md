# fixed-ignores-positioned-parent — opencode/qwen3.5-plus

- arm: `resolved`
- probes: a fixed box resolving against the viewport, not a positioned ancestor
- expected: 25,15 — a fixed box resolves against the viewport, so the positioned parent and its padding are both ignored

## Question

`root` is `position: relative` with 40px of padding, and `root>inner` is `position: fixed` with `top: 15px; left: 25px`. At what x,y does the top-left corner of `root>inner` render?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 600x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root        div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=80
  = position: relative, padding: 40px

root>inner  div  "fixed"
  @ x=25 y=15 width=70 height=20
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: fixed, top: 15px, left: 25px, width: 70px, height: 20px
```

## Model reply

For `position: fixed` elements, positioning is relative to the viewport, not the parent element. The parent's `position: relative` and 40px padding do not affect the fixed element's position. The `top: 15px` and `left: 25px` values are applied directly from the viewport origin.

The rendered bounding box confirms this: `@ x=25 y=15`.

ANSWER: 25,15
