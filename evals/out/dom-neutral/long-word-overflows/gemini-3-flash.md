# long-word-overflows — opencode/gemini-3-flash

- arm: `dom`
- probes: an unbreakable token wider than its box
- expected: NO — there is no break opportunity in the URL, so the single word runs to ~518px and is painted outside the box

## Question

Does the URL in `root>cell` stay inside `root>cell`'s 120px-wide box?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root       div
root>cell  div  "https://example.com/a/very/long/path/that/never/breaks"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=600 height=19.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 600px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>cell <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=120 height=19.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 120px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px
```

## Model reply

The URL "https://example.com/a/very/long/path/that/never/breaks" is 61 characters long. At a font size of 16px, even a narrow average character width (e.g., 8px) would result in a total width of nearly 500px, which far exceeds the 120px width of the `root>cell` container. Because the `overflow` property is set to `visible`, the text will not be clipped or wrapped, causing it to protrude outside the box.
