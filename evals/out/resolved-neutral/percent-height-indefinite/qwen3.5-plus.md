# percent-height-indefinite — opencode/qwen3.5-plus

- arm: `resolved`
- probes: a percentage height whose containing block is indefinite
- expected: NO — `root>outer` has no declared height, so the percentage behaves as `auto` and `tall` is one line (~19px) against `filler`'s 60px
- parsed answer: `NO`
- verdict: **PASS**
- elapsed: 11481ms

## Question

`root>outer>tall` declares `height: 100%`. Is it taller than its sibling `root>outer>filler`?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 600x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root               div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=79.19

root>outer         div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=79.19

root>outer>filler  div  "a"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=60
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), height: 60px

root>outer>tall    div  "b"
  @ x=0 y=60 width=600 height=19.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), height: 100%
```

## Model reply

Looking at the rendered dimensions:

- `root>outer>filler` has a height of **60px**
- `root>outer>tall` has a height of **19.19px** (despite declaring `height: 100%`)

The `height: 100%` on `tall` resolves to 19.19px in the actual rendering, which is significantly less than its sibling's 60px. The percentage height is calculated based on the containing block's height, not the sibling's height.

ANSWER: NO
