# long-word-overflows — opencode/gpt-5.4-mini

- arm: `shot`
- probes: an unbreakable token wider than its box
- expected: NO — there is no break opportunity in the URL, so the single word runs to ~518px and is painted outside the box

## Question

Does the URL in `root>cell` stay inside `root>cell`'s 120px-wide box?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root       div
root>cell  div  "https://example.com/a/very/long/path/that/never/breaks"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

No. The URL is a single long unbroken string, and in the screenshot it visibly runs far past the narrow 120px cell width instead of wrapping or clipping within it. So it does not stay inside the box.

ANSWER: NO
