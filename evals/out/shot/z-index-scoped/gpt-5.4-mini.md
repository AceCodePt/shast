## Question

`root>low>inner` and `root>high` overlap. Which of the two is the one a viewer sees in the overlapping region?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root            div
root>low        div
root>low>inner  div  "inner"
root>high       div  "high"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

In the overlap, the red `high` box is on top of the blue `inner` box. The screenshot shows `high` covering the portion of `inner` where they intersect, so a viewer sees `root>high` in the shared region.

ANSWER: root>high
