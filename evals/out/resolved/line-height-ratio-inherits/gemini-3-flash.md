# line-height-ratio-inherits — opencode/gemini-3-flash

- arm: `resolved`
- probes: a unitless line-height inheriting as a ratio rather than a length
- expected: 64 — the unitless 2 inherits as a ratio and re-resolves against 32px, rather than inheriting the root's computed 32px line box
- parsed answer: `64`

## Question

`root` declares `font-size: 16px` and `line-height: 2`. `root>big` declares `font-size: 32px` and nothing else. How tall does `root>big` render?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 600x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root        div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=96
  = font-size: 16px, line-height: 2

root>small  div  "small"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=32
  = font-size: 16px (inherited)

root>big    div  "big"
  @ x=0 y=32 width=600 height=64
  = font-size: 32px
```

## Model reply

The `root` element defines a unitless `line-height: 2`, which is inherited by its child `root>big` as a multiplier rather than a fixed value. With `root>big` having a `font-size` of 32px, its computed line height becomes 64px (32px * 2). The provided report confirms this by explicitly listing the measured height of the `root>big` box as 64.

ANSWER: 64
