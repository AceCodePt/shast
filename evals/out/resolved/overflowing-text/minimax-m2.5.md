# overflowing-text — opencode/minimax-m2.5

- arm: `resolved`
- probes: content taller than a fixed height spills outside the box; it is not cut off

## Question

Does all of `root>card`'s text fit inside `root>card`'s own 48px-tall border box?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 400x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root       div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=48

root>card  div  "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month."
  @ x=0 y=0 width=180 height=48  wrapped overflows
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), width: 180px, height: 48px, padding: 8px, border-width: 1px, border-style: solid
  ! wrapped: text broke onto 4 lines at 162px content width
  ! overflows: content is 153.61x76.75px inside a 162x30px content box, so it is painted outside the box rather than cut off (overflow is visible)
```

## Model reply

The content area inside `root>card` is only 30px tall (48px border box minus 16px padding and 2px border), but the rendered text measures 76.75px tall. The report explicitly notes `overflows: content is ... 76.75px tall inside a ... 30px content box, so it is painted outside the box rather than cut off`. Since `overflow: visible` is in effect, the text extends outside the 48px border box rather than being clipped to it.

ANSWER: NO
