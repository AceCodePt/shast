# state-over-ancestor — opencode/gemini-3-flash

- arm: `shot`
- probes: a state delta on top of a three-level cascade, where the resting winner is not the node's own
- expected: 2px — the root's three-segment selector outranks the node's own :hover, so hovering changes nothing

## Question

What padding does `root>mid>leaf` render with while the pointer is hovering over it?

## Context shown to the model

![rest.png](rest.png)
![hover.png](hover.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root           div
root>mid       div
root>mid>leaf  div  "Leaf"

Two screenshots of the rendered page are attached, both 500x300 CSS px at 1 device pixel per CSS px: first the page at rest, then the page while the mouse hovers `root>mid>leaf`. Compare them.
```

## Model reply

Comparing the provided screenshots, `rest.png` and `hover.png` are identical. In both images, the text "Leaf" is positioned at the top-left corner of the viewport. Since there is no change in the position of the text when the pointer hovers over the `root>mid>leaf` element, and the text remains flush against the top-left (accounting for standard font rendering), the element is not rendering with any padding.

ANSWER: 0px
