# union-coverage — opencode/claude-haiku-4-5

- arm: `dom`
- probes: two coverers that hide half a line each; neither alone would hide it

## Question

Can a viewer read the words in `root>line`? Note that neither covering box on its own spans the whole line.

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root            div
root>line       div  "Hidden by two"
root>leftHalf   div
root>rightHalf  div

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=200
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)

  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible

  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px

## Model reply

Looking at the bounding rectangles:

- `root>line` is a div at position x=0, y=0 with width=400 and height=19.1875
- `root>leftHalf` is positioned absolutely at x=0, y=0 with width=70 and height=20
- `root>rightHalf` is positioned absolutely at x=60, y=0 with width=80 and height=20

The two covering boxes overlap the text in `root>line`, but as noted, neither spans the whole line. The `leftHalf` covers x=0 to x=70, and `rightHalf` covers x=60 to x=140. Together they cover x=0 to x=140, but `root>line` extends to x=400.

This means the portion of `root>line` from x=140 onwards (a width of 260 pixels) is not covered by either box and remains visible. Since part of the text is visible and not obscured, a viewer can read at least some of the words in `root>line`.

ANSWER: YES
