## Question

Exactly what characters does a viewer see inside `root>title`?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root        div
root>title  div  "Annual review"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 500x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

The source text `"Annual review"` is rendered with CSS text-transform (uppercase), making all letters appear capitalized on the screen. As shown in the attached screenshot and rendered view, the text is displayed as uppercase.

ANSWER: ANNUAL REVIEW
