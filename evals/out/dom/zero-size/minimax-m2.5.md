# zero-size — opencode/minimax-m2.5

## Question

`root>ghost` renders at 0x0. Are the words "Important warning" nevertheless painted somewhere on the page?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root          div
root>ghost    div  "Important warning"
root>visible  div  "Everything is fine"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 19.1875px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 400px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>ghost <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=0 height=0
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px

  line-height: 19.2px

  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>visible <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px

## Model reply

Looking at the measurements, `root` has a height of 19.1875px, which corresponds to exactly one line of text (matching the line-height of 19.2px). The `root>visible` element also has height 19.1875 and occupies that single line at y=0 with "Everything is fine". 

`root>ghost` has width=0 and height=0 with `overflow: visible`. Even though overflow allows content to escape the box bounds, a zero-width inline formatting context typically collapses line boxes and prevents text from painting. More decisively, if any text from `root>ghost` were rendered, it would either add to `root`'s total height (it does not — it stays at one line) or overlap the line already occupied by `root>visible` at y=0. There is no second line of layout space anywhere on the page for "Important warning" to occupy.
