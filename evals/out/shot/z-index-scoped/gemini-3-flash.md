## Question

`root>low>inner` and `root>high` overlap. Which of the two is the one a viewer sees in the overlapping region?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root            div
root>low        div
root>low>inner  div  "inner"
root>high       div  "high"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

The screenshot shows a red rectangle labeled "high" overlapping a blue rectangle labeled "inner". The red rectangle is rendered on top of the blue rectangle, obscuring it in the overlapping region. Based on the node tree, the text "high" corresponds to `root>high` and the text "inner" corresponds to `root>low>inner`.

ANSWER: root>high
