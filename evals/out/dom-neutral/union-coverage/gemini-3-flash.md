# union-coverage — opencode/gemini-3-flash

- arm: `dom`
- probes: two coverers that hide half a line each; neither alone would hide it
- expected: NO — together the two cover the whole line

## Question

Can a viewer read the words in `root>line`? Note that neither covering box on its own spans the whole line.

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root            div
root>line       div  "Hidden by two"
root>leftHalf   div
root>rightHalf  div

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=200
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)

## Model reply

The text "Hidden by two" in `root>line` is located at the top of the container (y=0) with a height of approximately 19px. Two subsequent elements, `root>leftHalf` and `root>rightHalf`, are both `position: absolute` and also start at y=0 with a height of 20px, meaning they vertically overlap the text entirely. `leftHalf` covers the horizontal range from x=0 to x=70, and `rightHalf` covers the range from x=60 to x=140; because they overlap between x=60 and x=70, they form a continuous opaque block from x=0 to x=140. Since the 13-character text string starts at x=0 and would reasonably fit within 140px at a 16px font size, it is fully obscured by the opaque backgrounds of the two covering boxes.
