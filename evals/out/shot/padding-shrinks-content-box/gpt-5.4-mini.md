## Question

How many lines does the text inside `root>card` wrap onto?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root       div
root>card  div  "one two three four five six seven eight nine ten"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

The `root>card` text wraps into 4 lines. In the screenshot, the words are broken into four separate rows: `one two three`, `four five six`, `seven eight`, and `nine ten`.

ANSWER: 4
