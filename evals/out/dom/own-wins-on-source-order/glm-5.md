## Question

Three different blocks declare `padding` for `root>child`. What padding does it actually render with?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root        div
root>child  div  "Child"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=147.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>child <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=147.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 64px 64px 64px 64px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px
```

## Model reply

Based on the browser's computed style data, `root>child` has `padding: 64px 64px 64px 64px`, meaning 64px on all four sides (top, right, bottom, left). Regardless of how many CSS blocks declare padding, the cascade resolves to a single winning value per side, and here the winner is 64px uniformly. The `getBoundingClientRect` confirms this: the child fills the full 500px viewport width (so horizontal padding stays internal at 64px each side within content flow), and its height of 147.1875px reflects the content height plus 64px top and 64px bottom padding.

ANSWER: 64px
