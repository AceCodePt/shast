# long-word-overflows — opencode/glm-5

- arm: `dom`
- probes: an unbreakable token wider than its box
- expected: NO — there is no break opportunity in the URL, so the single word runs to ~518px and is painted outside the box
- parsed answer: `NO`
- verdict: **PASS**

## Question

Does the URL in `root>cell` stay inside `root>cell`'s 120px-wide box?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root       div
root>cell  div  "https://example.com/a/very/long/path/that/never/breaks"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=600 height=19.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 600px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>cell <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=120 height=19.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 120px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px
```

## Model reply

## Reasoning

The `root>cell` div has a computed width of **120px** and contains the long URL `https://example.com/a/very/long/path/that/never/breaks`. URLs are a single unbreakable "word" — browsers won't insert line breaks within them unless CSS like `word-break: break-all` or `overflow-wrap: break-word` is applied.

Looking at the computed style of `root>cell`:
- **overflow: visible** — content is allowed to spill out, not clipped.
- No `word-break`, `overflow-wrap`, or `word-wrap` property is shown that would force the long string to wrap.

Since there are no break opportunities in the URL and no CSS to force breaking, the text will overflow horizontally beyond the 120px box boundary. The box itself remains 120px wide (confirmed by `getBoundingClientRect`), but the rendered text extends past it.
