# long-word-overflows — opencode/gemini-3.5-flash-lite

- arm: `resolved`
- probes: an unbreakable token wider than its box
- expected: NO — there is no break opportunity in the URL, so the single word runs to ~518px and is painted outside the box
- parsed answer: `NO`

## Question

Does the URL in `root>cell` stay inside `root>cell`'s 120px-wide box?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 600x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root       div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=19.19

root>cell  div  "https://example.com/a/very/long/path/that/never/breaks"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=120 height=19.19  overflows
  = width: 120px, font-size: 16px
  ! overflows: content is 518.41x19.19px inside a 120x19.19px content box, so it is painted outside the box rather than cut off (overflow is visible)
```

## Model reply

The machine-generated report explicitly states that the content overflows the 120px-wide content box, measuring 518.41px wide and being painted outside the box. Therefore, the URL does not stay inside the box.

ANSWER: NO
