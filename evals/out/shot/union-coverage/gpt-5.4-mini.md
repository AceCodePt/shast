# union-coverage — opencode/gpt-5.4-mini

- arm: `shot`
- probes: two coverers that hide half a line each; neither alone would hide it

## Question

Can a viewer read the words in `root>line`? Note that neither covering box on its own spans the whole line.

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root            div
root>line       div  "Hidden by two"
root>leftHalf   div
root>rightHalf  div

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 400x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

No. The screenshot shows the line area is fully obscured by the two covering boxes, so there are no readable letters left exposed. Even though each box alone does not span the whole line, their combined coverage blocks the text from view.

ANSWER: NO
