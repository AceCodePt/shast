## Question

What is the background colour of `root>cta` when the page is first painted and the pointer is elsewhere?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 400x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root      div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=43.19

root>cta  div  "Continue"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=43.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), background-color: #3355ff, padding: 12px
  :hover  background-color: #0022cc
```

## Model reply

When the page is first painted, the `:hover` state does not apply because the pointer is elsewhere. The base style for `root>cta` sets `background-color: #3355ff`, and that inherited/non-hover value is what Chromium initially uses.  

ANSWER: #3355ff
