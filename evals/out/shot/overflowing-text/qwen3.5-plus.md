## Question

Does all of `root>card`'s text fit inside `root>card`'s own 48px-tall border box?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root       div
root>card  div  "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month."

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 400x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

Looking at the screenshot, I can see a bordered box at the top containing only the first two lines of text ("Payment failed because the card"), while the remaining text ("on file expired last month.") appears **outside** and below the bordered box.

This visual evidence shows the text is overflowing the 48px-tall container - the border does not encompass all four lines of text.

ANSWER: NO
