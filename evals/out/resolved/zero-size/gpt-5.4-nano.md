# zero-size — opencode/gpt-5.4-nano

- arm: `resolved`
- probes: a node that renders at no size while carrying content

## Question

`root>ghost` renders at 0x0. Are the words "Important warning" nevertheless painted somewhere on the page?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 400x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root          div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.19

root>ghost    div  "Important warning"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=0 height=0  wrapped overflows zero collides
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), height: 0px, width: 0px
  ! wrapped: text broke onto 2 lines at 0px content width
  ! overflows: content is 86.41x38.38px inside a 0x0px content box, so it is painted outside the box rather than cut off (overflow is visible)
  ! zero: 0x0px
  ! collides: root>visible <div> draws its text on the same pixels, over 56% of this node's glyphs

root>visible  div  "Everything is fine"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.19  collides
  = font-size: 16px (inherited)
  ! collides: root>ghost <div> draws its text on the same pixels, over 50% of this node's glyphs
```

## Model reply

`root>ghost` has a measured border box of `0x0` at `x=0,y=0` (so its own box size is zero), but the report explicitly says its text overflows a `0x0` content box and that overflow is **visible**, meaning the glyphs are still painted outside the zero-sized box rather than clipped. It also states that `root>ghost` draws its text on the same pixels as `root>visible`, confirming the words are rendered somewhere on the page.  

ANSWER: YES
