## Question

Exactly what characters does a viewer see inside `root>title`?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 500x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root        div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=500 height=19.19
  = text-transform: uppercase

root>title  div  "ANNUAL REVIEW"  (written "Annual review")
  @ x=0 y=0 width=500 height=19.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited)
```

## Model reply

The information shows that `root>title` contains text that was written as "Annual review" in the source, but the parent element has `text-transform: uppercase` CSS applied. This causes the text to be rendered in uppercase. The rendered output explicitly shows `"ANNUAL REVIEW"`.

ANSWER: ANNUAL REVIEW
