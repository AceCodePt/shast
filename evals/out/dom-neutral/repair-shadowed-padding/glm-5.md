# repair-shadowed-padding — opencode/glm-5

- arm: `dom`
- probes: naming the block to edit, having been told the obvious edit failed
- expected: root>body — its `> panel` block is (0,2,0) against the panel's own (0,1,0), so the panel's own declaration can never win and the 4px has to be changed where it is written

## Question

You want `root>body>panel` to render with 32px of padding. Which node's css block do you have to edit to get it?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x300

root             div
root>body        div
root>body>panel  section  "Panel"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-radius: 0px
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>body <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-radius: 0px
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>body>panel <section>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-radius: 8px
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 4px 4px 4px 4px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

The evidence above is the page exactly as it stands. Consider that `padding: 32px` has already been added to `root>body>panel`'s own css block — it is there in the source — and the rendering did not change. You are not shown a rendering of the outcome — work it out from the evidence.

## Model reply

## Reasoning

The computed style for `root>body>panel` shows `padding: 4px` and `border-radius: 8px`. We're told `padding: 32px` was already added to the panel's **own** CSS block, yet the computed padding remained `4px` — meaning the panel's own block is losing the cascade for the `padding` property.

The fact that `border-radius: 8px` **did** take effect on the panel suggests the panel's own block is partially applying (border-radius wins), but a higher-specificity rule from another node's CSS block is overriding only `padding` to `4px`. In these CSS-TS systems, a parent node's CSS block can target its child elements. The direct parent `root>body` is the node whose CSS block is setting `padding: 4px` (and likely `border-radius: 8px` too) on the `<section>` child, winning over the panel's own `padding: 32px`.

Therefore, to get `32px` of padding on the panel, you must edit the CSS block of the node that is currently authoritatively setting that `4px` padding — the parent.

ANSWER: root>body
