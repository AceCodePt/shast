## Question

Is `root>footer` inside the area the viewer sees when the page first loads, before any scrolling?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 500x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root         div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=500 height=800
  = position: relative, height: 800px

root>top     div  "masthead"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=500 height=40
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), height: 40px

root>footer  div  "footer note"
  @ x=0 y=700 width=500 height=60  below-fold
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 700px, left: 0px, width: 500px, height: 60px
```

## Model reply

The viewport height is 300px, meaning only content within the vertical range of y=0 to y=300 is visible when the page first loads. The `root>footer` is positioned at y=700, which is far below the bottom edge of the initial viewport. Furthermore, the provided information explicitly labels the element as "below-fold."

ANSWER: NO
