## Question

Is `root>footer` inside the area the viewer sees when the page first loads, before any scrolling?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root         div
root>top     div  "masthead"
root>footer  div  "footer note"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 500x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

No. The viewport is only `500x300`, and the screenshot shows only the `masthead` near the top with empty space below it. Since `root>footer` is not visible in the initial render area, it is below the fold and would require scrolling to see.

ANSWER: NO
