# repair-shadowed-padding — opencode/gemini-3.5-flash-lite

- arm: `dom`
- probes: naming the block to edit, having been told the obvious edit failed
- expected: root>body — its `> panel` block is (0,2,0) against the panel's own (0,1,0), so the panel's own declaration can never win and the 4px has to be changed where it is written

## Question

You want `root>body>panel` to render with 32px of padding. Which node's css block do you have to edit to get it?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x300

root             div
root>body        div
root>body>panel  section  "Panel"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-radius: 0px
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>body <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-radius: 0px
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>body>panel <section>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-radius: 8px
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 4px 4px 4px 4px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

The evidence above is the page exactly as it stands. Consider that `padding: 32px` has already been added to `root>body>panel`'s own css block — it is there in the source — and the rendering did not change. You are not shown a rendering of the outcome — work it out from the evidence.
```

## Model reply

Since adding `32px` of padding to `root>body>panel`'s own CSS block produced no change in the rendered output (leaving it at `4px`), the property is being overridden by a conflicting rule or selector with higher precedence. This overriding rule is defined in the CSS block of its direct parent node, which governs styles applied to its descendants. Therefore, you must edit the CSS block of `root>body`.

ANSWER: root>body
