- arm: `shot`
- probes: flex-grow dividing the free space
- expected: 400 — the free 600px is split 1:2, so `root>b` gets two thirds

## Question

`root` is `display: flex`. `root>a` has `flex: 1` and `root>b` has `flex: 2`. How wide is `root>b`?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root    div
root>a  div  "A"
root>b  div  "B"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

`flex: 1` and `flex: 2` split the flex container’s available width in a 1:2 ratio. With a 600px-wide viewport and no other constraints shown, `root>b` gets 2/3 of the space.

ANSWER: 400
