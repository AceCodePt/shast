- arm: `resolved`

## Question

The last line of `root>card`'s text sits below the bottom edge of `root>card`. Is that last line still painted on the page, where a person could read it?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 400x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root       div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=48

root>card  div  "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month."
  @ x=0 y=0 width=180 height=48  wrapped overflows
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), width: 180px, height: 48px, padding: 8px, border-width: 1px, border-style: solid
  ! wrapped: text broke onto 4 lines at 162px content width
  ! overflows: content is 153.61x76.75px inside a 162x30px content box, so it is painted outside the box rather than cut off (overflow is visible)
```

## Model reply

The `root>card` element has a content box of 162x30px (after subtracting 8px padding and 1px border from each side of the 180x48px total). The text content measures 153.61x76.75px, which is much taller than the 30px content box. However, the annotation explicitly states `overflow is visible`, meaning content that exceeds the box boundaries is painted outside the box rather than being clipped or hidden.

ANSWER: YES
