# percent-height-indefinite — opencode/claude-haiku-4-5

- arm: `shot+dom`
- probes: a percentage height whose containing block is indefinite
- expected: NO — `root>outer` has no declared height, so the percentage behaves as `auto` and `tall` is one line (~19px) against `filler`'s 60px
- parsed answer: `NO`
- verdict: **PASS**

## Question

`root>outer>tall` declares `height: 100%`. Is it taller than its sibling `root>outer>filler`?

## Context shown to the model

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root               div
root>outer         div
root>outer>filler  div  "a"
root>outer>tall    div  "b"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

## Model reply

Looking at the bounding client rectangles provided:

- `root>outer>filler` has a height of 60px
- `root>outer>tall` has a height of 19.1875px

The question asks if `root>outer>tall` (which declares `height: 100%`) is taller than its sibling `root>outer>filler`.

Since `root>outer>tall` is 19.1875px and `root>outer>filler` is 60px, `root>outer>tall` is clearly shorter than its sibling. The `height: 100%` declaration on `root>outer>tall` resolves to 19.1875px, which means it's only taking up about 32% of the filler's height. This likely occurs because the parent `root>outer` has a computed height of 79.1875px, and when percentage heights are applied to block elements in a flex or flow context where the parent height is determined by its content, the percentage resolution can behave differently than expected.

ANSWER: NO
