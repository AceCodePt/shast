## Question

Four rows are stacked down the page. Three of them share the same left edge and one does not. Which one is out of alignment?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 500x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root         div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=500 height=300
  = position: relative, height: 300px

root>first   div  "first"
  @ x=24 y=20 width=200 height=30
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 20px, left: 24px, width: 200px, height: 30px

root>second  div  "second"
  @ x=24 y=60 width=200 height=30
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 60px, left: 24px, width: 200px, height: 30px

root>third   div  "third"
  @ x=40 y=100 width=200 height=30
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 100px, left: 40px, width: 200px, height: 30px

root>fourth  div  "fourth"
  @ x=24 y=140 width=200 height=30
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 140px, left: 24px, width: 200px, height: 30px
```

## Model reply

Three rows have the same left edge at `x=24`: **first**, **second**, and **fourth**. The **third** row is the one that differs, with its left edge at `x=40` instead of `x=24`. Therefore, **third** is out of alignment.

ANSWER: root>third
