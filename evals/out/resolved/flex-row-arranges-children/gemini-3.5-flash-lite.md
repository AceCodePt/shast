- arm: `resolved`
- probes: flex-row placement with a gap
- expected: 110 — the first item is 100px wide and the gap adds 10px, so the second starts at 100 + 10

## Question

`root` is `display: flex` with `gap: 10px`, containing two 100px-wide children. At what x does `root>second`'s left edge render?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 600x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root         div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=19.19
  = display: flex, flex-direction: row, gap: 10px

root>first   div  "first"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=100 height=19.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), width: 100px

root>second  div  "second"
  @ x=110 y=0 width=100 height=19.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), width: 100px
```

## Model reply

According to the provided machine-generated report, the bounding box for `root>second` explicitly specifies its position as `x=110 y=0 width=100 height=19.19`. Therefore, its left edge renders at an x-coordinate of 110 pixels.

ANSWER: 110
