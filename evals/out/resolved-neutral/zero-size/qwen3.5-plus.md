# zero-size — opencode/qwen3.5-plus

- arm: `resolved`
- probes: a node that renders at no size while carrying content

## Question

`root>ghost` renders at 0x0. Are the words "Important warning" nevertheless painted somewhere on the page?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 400x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root          div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.19

root>ghost    div  "Important warning"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=0 height=0  wrapped overflows zero collides
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), height: 0px, width: 0px
  ! wrapped: text broke onto 2 lines at 0px content width
  ! overflows: content is 86.41x38.38px inside a 0x0px content box, so it is painted outside the box rather than cut off (overflow is visible)
  ! zero: 0x0px
  ! collides: root>visible <div> draws its text on the same pixels, over 56% of this node's glyphs

root>visible  div  "Everything is fine"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.19  collides
  = font-size: 16px (inherited)
  ! collides: root>ghost <div> draws its text on the same pixels, over 50% of this node's glyphs
```

## Model reply

The information explicitly states that `root>ghost` has `overflow: visible` (implied by the overflow behavior description). Even though its box is 0x0 pixels, the text content measuring 86.41x38.38px is "painted outside the box rather than cut off." Additionally, the collision note confirms that this node's glyphs are being drawn and overlapping with `root>visible`'s text on over 56% of the glyphs.

ANSWER: YES
