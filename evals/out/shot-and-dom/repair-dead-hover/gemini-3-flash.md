# repair-dead-hover — opencode/gemini-3-flash

- arm: `shot+dom`
- probes: naming the block that is killing a state, not the state's own block
- expected: root — its `> mid > leaf` block is (0,3,0) and outranks the leaf's own `:hover` at (0,2,0), so the hover is dead until the root's block changes
- parsed answer: `root>mid`

## Question

You want `root>mid>leaf` to grow to 40px of padding on hover. Which node's css block do you have to edit to get it?

## Context shown to the model

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root           div
root>mid       div
root>mid>leaf  div  "Leaf"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid>leaf <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

Then the same data again while the mouse hovers `root>mid>leaf` — compare the two for what the `:hover` state changes:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid>leaf <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

Two screenshots of the rendered page are attached, both 500x300 CSS px at 1 device pixel per CSS px: first the page at rest, then the page while the mouse hovers `root>mid>leaf`. Compare them.

The evidence above is the page exactly as it stands. Consider that `:hover { padding: 40px }` has already been added to `root>mid>leaf`'s own css block — it is there in the source — and hovering changes nothing. You are not shown a rendering of the outcome — work it out from the evidence.
```

## Model reply

The rendered data and screenshots show that hovering over `root>mid>leaf` does not trigger the `:hover { padding: 40px }` style, even though the rule exists in the leaf's CSS block. This "dead hover" occurs because the leaf element is not receiving pointer events, typically because an ancestor is intercepting them or has disabled them for its descendants. In this specific hierarchy, the intermediate `root>mid` node is the most likely location of a `pointer-events: none` property that is blocking the hover state from reaching the leaf. By editing the CSS block for `root>mid` to enable pointer events or by defining the hover trigger at the `mid` level to affect its child, the desired padding change can be achieved.

ANSWER: root>mid
