## Question

The last line of `root>card`'s text sits below the bottom edge of `root>card`. Is that last line still painted on the page, where a person could read it?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root       div
root>card  div  "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month."

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=48
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-style: solid
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 48px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 400px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>card <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=180 height=48
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-style: solid
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 48px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 180px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 8px 8px 8px 8px
  border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 400x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.

## Model reply

The `root>card` element has `overflow: visible`, which means any content overflowing its defined height is not clipped. As seen in both the rendered screenshot and the element's properties, the text extends past the bottom edge of the container and is fully rendered on the page, making it readable.
