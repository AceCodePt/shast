## Question

`root>ghost` renders at 0x0. Are the words "Important warning" nevertheless painted somewhere on the page?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root          div
root>ghost    div  "Important warning"
root>visible  div  "Everything is fine"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 400x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

The screenshot shows that the word "warning" is clearly visible on the second line of the rendered page. Additionally, the first line shows characters from the word "Important" superimposed on "Everything is fine," indicating that the text content of the `root>ghost` node was indeed painted despite the node itself having a reported size of 0x0.

ANSWER: YES
