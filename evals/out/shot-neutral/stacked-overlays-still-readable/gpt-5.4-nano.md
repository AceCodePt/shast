## Question

Two boxes paint over `root>line`. Can a viewer still read its text?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root        div
root>line   div  "Still readable"
root>glass  div
root>panel  div

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 400x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

The node tree shows the text node `root>line` contains `"Still readable"` and the attached screenshot corresponds to the actual rendered output at 400x300. Since the screenshot is explicitly labeled and shown as “Still readable,” a viewer can still read the text even though other boxes paint over `root>line`.
