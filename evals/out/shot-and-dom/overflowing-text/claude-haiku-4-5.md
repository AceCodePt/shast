## Question

Does all of `root>card`'s text fit inside `root>card`'s own 48px-tall border box?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root       div
root>card  div  "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month."

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=48
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-style: solid
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 48px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 400px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>card <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=180 height=48
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-style: solid
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 48px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 180px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 8px 8px 8px 8px
  border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

## Model reply

Looking at the information provided:

The `root>card` element has a height of 48px with 8px padding on all sides, giving it an effective content height of 32px (48 - 8 - 8). The text "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month." is rendered with a font-size of 16px and line-height of 19.2px.

From the screenshot, the text clearly wraps across multiple lines (4 lines visible), and the text extends beyond the visible border box of the card. The card's bounding rectangle shows width=180px and height=48px, but the text content visibly overflows beyond this boundary, as shown in the rendered image where text appears cut off at the right edge and extends beyond the bottom.

Since the text visibly overflows the 48px height constraint of the card element, not all of the text fits inside the border box.

ANSWER: NO
