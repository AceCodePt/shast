## Question

Which node's text is drawn on the same pixels as `root>ghost`'s text?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root          div
root>ghost    div  "Important warning"
root>visible  div  "Everything is fine"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 400x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

Based on the provided screenshot and node tree, the text "Important warning" from `root>ghost` overlaps directly with "Everything is fine" from `root>visible`, causing a visual collision on the exact same screen pixels.

ANSWER: root>visible
