## Question

Which renders with larger text, `root>heading` or `root>caption`?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root          div
root>heading  div  "Quarterly report"
root>caption  div  "Draft"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 500x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

Looking at the screenshot, "Quarterly report" (the heading) is visibly rendered with larger, bolder text compared to "Draft" (the caption), which appears smaller and lighter. This follows typical typographic conventions where headings are styled larger than captions.

ANSWER: root>heading
