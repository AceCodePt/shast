## Question

`root` is `display: flex` with `gap: 10px`, containing two 100px-wide children. At what x does `root>second`'s left edge render?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 600x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root         div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=19.19
  = display: flex, flex-direction: row, gap: 10px

root>first   div  "first"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=100 height=19.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), width: 100px

root>second  div  "second"
  @ x=110 y=0 width=100 height=19.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), width: 100px
```

## Model reply

The first child spans x=0 to x=100. The flex `gap: 10px` inserts 10px between items, so the second child's left edge is at 100 + 10 = 110. This matches the report.

ANSWER: 110
