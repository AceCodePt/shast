## Question

The last line of `root>card`'s text sits below the bottom edge of `root>card`. Is that last line still painted on the page, where a person could read it?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 400x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root       div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=48

root>card  div  "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month."
  @ x=0 y=0 width=180 height=48  wrapped overflows
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), width: 180px, height: 48px, padding: 8px, border-width: 1px, border-style: solid
  ! wrapped: text broke onto 4 lines at 162px content width
  ! overflows: content is 153.61x76.75px inside a 162x30px content box, so it is painted outside the box rather than cut off (overflow is visible)
```

## Model reply

Yes. The report says the text “wrapped overflows” and that the content is painted outside the box rather than cut off (“overflow is visible”). Since the last line extends below `root>card`’s bottom edge, it is still part of the visible painted overflow content, so a person could read it on the page.

ANSWER: YES
