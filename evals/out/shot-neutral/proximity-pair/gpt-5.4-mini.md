## Question

`root>alpha`, `root>beta` and `root>gamma` are siblings. Which single one of the three is visually separated from the other two?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x400

root        div
root>alpha  div  "alpha"
root>beta   div  "beta"
root>gamma  div  "gamma"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 400x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

`root>gamma` is visually separated from the other two: `alpha` and `beta` are close together near the top, while `gamma` sits much lower with a large blank gap above it.

ANSWER: root>gamma
