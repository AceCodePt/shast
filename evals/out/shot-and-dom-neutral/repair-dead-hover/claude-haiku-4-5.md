# repair-dead-hover — opencode/claude-haiku-4-5

- arm: `shot+dom`
- probes: naming the block that is killing a state, not the state's own block
- expected: root — its `> mid > leaf` block is (0,3,0) and outranks the leaf's own `:hover` at (0,2,0), so the hover is dead until the root's block changes
- parsed answer: ``root>mid`
- verdict: **FAIL (answer-line slip or no reply)**

## Question

You want `root>mid>leaf` to grow to 40px of padding on hover. Which node's css block do you have to edit to get it?

The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root           div
root>mid       div
root>mid>leaf  div  "Leaf"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid>leaf <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

Then the same data again while the mouse hovers `root>mid>leaf` — compare the two for what the `:hover` state changes:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid>leaf <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

Two screenshots of the rendered page are attached, both 500x300 CSS px at 1 device pixel per CSS px: first the page at rest, then the page while the mouse hovers `root>mid>leaf`. Compare them.

The evidence above is the page exactly as it stands. Consider that `:hover { padding: 40px }` has already been added to `root>mid>leaf`'s own css block — it is there in the source — and hovering changes nothing. You are not shown a rendering of the outcome — work it out from the evidence.

## Model reply

Looking at the evidence provided:

1. The HTML structure shows a chain: `root` > `root>mid` > `root>mid>leaf`
2. The problem states that `:hover { padding: 40px }` has already been added to `root>mid>leaf`'s CSS block, but hovering produces no visual change
3. Comparing the two rendered states (rest vs hover), the computed styles for all three nodes are identical - nothing changes on hover
4. The issue is that `root>mid>leaf` has `display: block`, which means it takes up the full width (500px). When you add padding to a block element, the padding is applied but doesn't cause the element to grow visually in width - it just compresses the content area

The real problem is that `root>mid` is the parent container that needs to be aware of changes to its child's padding. Since `root>mid>leaf` is already styled with the hover rule but it's not working, the issue is that the parent `root>mid` is not responding to layout changes in its child, or there's a constraint preventing the growth.

However, looking more carefully: if `:hover { padding: 40px }` is already in `root>mid>leaf`'s CSS and nothing is happening, the most likely issue is that either `root>mid` or `root` needs to have their CSS modified to allow the child to grow, or there's a `width` constraint somewhere.

Since the question asks which node's CSS block to edit, and the hover rule is already on `root>mid>leaf` but not working, the answer must be to edit the parent that's constraining it.

ANSWER: `root>mid`
