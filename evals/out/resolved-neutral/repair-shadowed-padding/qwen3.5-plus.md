# repair-shadowed-padding — opencode/qwen3.5-plus

- arm: `resolved`
- probes: naming the block to edit, having been told the obvious edit failed
- expected: root>body — its `> panel` block is (0,2,0) against the panel's own (0,1,0), so the panel's own declaration can never win and the 4px has to be changed where it is written
- parsed answer: `root>body`

## Question

You want `root>body>panel` to render with 32px of padding. Which node's css block do you have to edit to get it?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 600x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root             div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.19

root>body        div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.19

root>body>panel  section  "Panel"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), padding: 4px, border-radius: 8px
  ← padding: 4px   declared by root>body, inside its "> panel" block   — shadows padding: 32px declared by root>body>panel itself, at the top of its css block

The evidence above is the page exactly as it stands. Consider that `padding: 32px` has already been added to `root>body>panel`'s own css block — it is there in the source — and the rendering did not change. You are not shown a rendering of the outcome — work it out from the evidence.

## Model reply

Looking at the evidence, the rendering shows `padding: 4px` is being applied to `root>body>panel`, even though `padding: 32px` exists in the panel's own CSS block. The annotation explicitly states that the 4px value is "declared by root>body, inside its `> panel` block" and that this "shadows padding: 32px declared by root>body>panel itself."

This means there's a nested selector structure where `root>body` has a child selector block (`> panel`) that overrides the panel's own declarations. To get 32px padding, I need to change the winning rule — the one in `root>body`'s `> panel` block.

ANSWER: root>body
