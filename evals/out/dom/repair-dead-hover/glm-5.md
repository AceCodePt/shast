# repair-dead-hover — opencode/glm-5

- arm: `dom`
- probes: naming the block that is killing a state, not the state's own block
- expected: root — its `> mid > leaf` block is (0,3,0) and outranks the leaf's own `:hover` at (0,2,0), so the hover is dead until the root's block changes
- parsed answer: `root`

## Question

You want `root>mid>leaf` to grow to 40px of padding on hover. Which node's css block do you have to edit to get it?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root           div
root>mid       div
root>mid>leaf  div  "Leaf"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid>leaf <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

Then the same data again while the mouse hovers `root>mid>leaf` — compare the two for what the `:hover` state changes:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid>leaf <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

The evidence above is the page exactly as it stands. Consider that `:hover { padding: 40px }` has already been added to `root>mid>leaf`'s own css block — it is there in the source — and hovering changes nothing. You are not shown a rendering of the outcome — work it out from the evidence.

## Model reply

## Reasoning

`root>mid>leaf` already carries `padding: 2px` in its base (non-hover) state, while `root` and `root>mid` have `0px`. So *something* is setting 2px of padding on the leaf from outside the leaf's own block. Adding `:hover { padding: 40px }` to the leaf's own block has **zero** effect — on hover the padding stays exactly `2px`, not `0`, not `40`. That means the 2px rule is beating the `:hover` rule on specificity (or source order), so the 2px is not coming from the leaf's own base rule (its own `:hover` would outrank a same-element base rule).

In a path-based CSS system, a rule authored in an ancestor's block that targets the leaf accumulates the classes along the path, giving it higher specificity the further up the tree it is written. The leaf's own `:hover` selector (roughly `.leaf:hover`, specificity `(0,2,0)`) is beaten by a rule written in `root`'s block targeting the leaf (roughly `.root .mid .leaf`, specificity `(0,3,0)`), but it would *not* be beaten by a rule written in `root>mid`'s block (`.mid .leaf`, `(0,2,0)`) — that ties and loses on source order because the leaf's block is emitted later.

So the only ancestor whose block can override the leaf's own `:hover` is `root`, which is where the winning `padding: 2px` must be defined. To get the 40px hover, you must edit `root`'s block (e.g. raise the hover rule to the same path specificity, `.root .mid .leaf:hover`).

ANSWER: root
