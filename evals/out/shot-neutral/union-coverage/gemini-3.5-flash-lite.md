# union-coverage — opencode/gemini-3.5-flash-lite

- arm: `shot`
- probes: two coverers that hide half a line each; neither alone would hide it

## Question

Can a viewer read the words in `root>line`? Note that neither covering box on its own spans the whole line.

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root            div
root>line       div  "Hidden by two"
root>leftHalf   div
root>rightHalf  div

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 400x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

The text in `root>line` is obscured by the combined union of `root>leftHalf` and `root>rightHalf`. Since together these boxes cover the entire line, the text cannot be read by a viewer.

ANSWER: NO
