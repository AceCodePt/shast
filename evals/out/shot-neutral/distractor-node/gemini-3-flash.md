## Question

Can a viewer read the text in `root>second`?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root         div
root>first   p    "First paragraph here"
root>second  p    "Second paragraph here"
root>cover   div

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 500x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

The screenshot clearly shows the text "Second paragraph here" rendered against a white background. Although there is a black bar at the top of the viewport (likely the `root>cover` node obscuring the `root>first` paragraph), the text belonging to `root>second` is fully visible and legible.

ANSWER: YES
