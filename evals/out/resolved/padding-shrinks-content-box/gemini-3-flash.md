## Question

How many lines does the text inside `root>card` wrap onto?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 600x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root       div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=124.75

root>card  div  "one two three four five six seven eight nine ten"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=200 height=124.75  wrapped
  = width: 200px, padding: 24px, font-size: 16px
  ! wrapped: text broke onto 4 lines at 152px content width
```

## Model reply

The report for `root>card` explicitly includes a measurement note regarding text wrapping. It states that the text "broke onto 4 lines" at a content width of 152px (calculated as the 200px total width minus 24px padding on each side).

ANSWER: 4
