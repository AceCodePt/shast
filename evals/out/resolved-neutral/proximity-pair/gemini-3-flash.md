## Question

`root>alpha`, `root>beta` and `root>gamma` are siblings. Which single one of the three is visually separated from the other two?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 400x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root        div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=300
  = position: relative, height: 300px

root>alpha  div  "alpha"
  @ x=20 y=20 width=120 height=40
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 20px, left: 20px, width: 120px, height: 40px

root>beta   div  "beta"
  @ x=20 y=64 width=120 height=40
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 64px, left: 20px, width: 120px, height: 40px

root>gamma  div  "gamma"
  @ x=20 y=200 width=120 height=40
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 200px, left: 20px, width: 120px, height: 40px
```

## Model reply

`alpha` and `beta` are positioned close together with only a 4px vertical gap between them (`alpha` ends at y=60 and `beta` starts at y=64). In contrast, `gamma` starts at y=200, creating a much larger 96px gap from the bottom of `beta`, making it visually isolated from the cluster formed by the first two.

ANSWER: root>gamma
