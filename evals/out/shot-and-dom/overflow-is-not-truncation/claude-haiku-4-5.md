## Question

The last line of `root>card`'s text sits below the bottom edge of `root>card`. Is that last line still painted on the page, where a person could read it?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root       div
root>card  div  "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month."

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=48
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-style: solid
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 48px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 400px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>card <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=180 height=48
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-style: solid
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 48px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 180px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 8px 8px 8px 8px
  border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

## Model reply

Looking at the provided data:

The `root>card` div has:
- Height: 48px
- Padding: 8px on all sides
- Overflow: visible
- Line-height: 19.2px

The text "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month." is displayed within this div. With 8px padding on top and bottom, the available content height is 48px - 16px = 32px, which fits only one line (line-height is 19.2px).

However, the screenshot clearly shows the text wrapping to multiple lines, with the last line ("last month.") extending below the 48px boundary of the card div.

The key detail is that `overflow: visible` means content that exceeds the box boundaries is still rendered and visible on the page. The browser's rendering shows the text is painted beyond the card's bounding box, and it's legible in the screenshot.

ANSWER: YES
