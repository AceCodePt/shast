## Question

You want `root>body>panel` to render with 32px of padding. Which node's css block do you have to edit to get it?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x300

root             div
root>body        div
root>body>panel  section  "Panel"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-radius: 0px
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>body <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-radius: 0px
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>body>panel <section>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-radius: 8px
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 4px 4px 4px 4px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

The evidence above is the page exactly as it stands. Consider that `padding: 32px` has already been added to `root>body>panel`'s own css block — it is there in the source — and the rendering did not change. You are not shown a rendering of the outcome — work it out from the evidence.
```

## Model reply

From the browser evidence, `root>body>panel` is the `<section>` node that corresponds to the element whose computed styles include `padding: 4px 4px 4px 4px`. The prompt explicitly says that `padding: 32px` has already been added to `root>body>panel`’s own CSS block and that the rendered result did not change, which identifies that this padding is controlled by that same node’s CSS block. Therefore, to make `root>body>panel` render with 32px padding, you must edit the CSS block for `root>body>panel`.

ANSWER: root>body>panel
