## Question

The four boxes form a two-by-two arrangement. Which node sits directly to the right of `root>leftBottom`, on the same row?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 800x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root              div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=800 height=300
  = position: relative, height: 300px

root>leftTop      div  "left top"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=300 height=80
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 0px, left: 0px, width: 300px, height: 80px

root>rightTop     div  "right top"
  @ x=340 y=0 width=300 height=80
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 0px, left: 340px, width: 300px, height: 80px

root>leftBottom   div  "left bottom"
  @ x=0 y=120 width=300 height=80
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 120px, left: 0px, width: 300px, height: 80px

root>rightBottom  div  "right bottom"
  @ x=340 y=120 width=300 height=80
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 120px, left: 340px, width: 300px, height: 80px
```

## Model reply

Looking at the report:

- `root>leftBottom` is positioned at x=0, y=120 with width=300, height=80
- This means it spans from x=0 to x=300 horizontally, and y=120 to y=200 vertically

For a node to be "directly to the right on the same row", it needs to share the same y-coordinate (y=120) and have a greater x value.

- `root>rightBottom` is at x=340, y=120 — same y position (same row), and x=340 is to the right of where `leftBottom` ends (x=300)

ANSWER: root>rightBottom
