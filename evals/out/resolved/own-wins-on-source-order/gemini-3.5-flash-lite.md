## Question

Three different blocks declare `padding` for `root>child`. What padding does it actually render with?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 500x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root        div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=500 height=147.19

root>child  div  "Child"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=500 height=147.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), padding: 64px
  ← padding: 64px   declared by root>child itself, inside its "&.big" block   — shadows padding: 4px declared by root, inside its "> child" block; also padding: 32px declared by root>child itself, at the top of its css block
```

## Model reply

The resolved styles for `root>child` explicitly show that its padding is evaluated to `64px`. This value is declared by `root>child` within its `&.big` block, which takes precedence by shadowing the `4px` padding declared by `root` and the `32px` padding declared at the top of `root>child`'s CSS block.

ANSWER: 64px
