## Question

Does all of `root>card`'s text fit inside `root>card`'s own 48px-tall border box?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root       div
root>card  div  "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month."

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=48
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-style: solid
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 48px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 400px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>card <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=180 height=48
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  border-style: solid
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px

  line-height: 19.2px

  border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

## Model reply

Looking at the information provided:

The `root>card` element has a height of 48px with padding of 8px on all sides, giving it a content box height of 48 - 16 = 32px (subtracting top and bottom padding).

The text inside uses a font-size of 16px with a line-height of 19.2px. The text "Payment failed because the card on file expired last month." is multiple lines, and from the screenshot, I can see it spans 4 lines of text.

With 4 lines at 19.2px per line, that's approximately 76.8px of text height needed. However, the content box only has 32px of vertical space available (48px total height minus 16px padding).

The screenshot clearly shows the text is overflowing - the bottom lines of text extend beyond the visible border box of the card element.

ANSWER: NO
