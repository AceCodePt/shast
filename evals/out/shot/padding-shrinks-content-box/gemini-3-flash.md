## Question

How many lines does the text inside `root>card` wrap onto?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root       div
root>card  div  "one two three four five six seven eight nine ten"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

The screenshot shows the text "one two three four five six seven eight nine ten" rendered within the card. Counting the lines from the image, the text is split into four rows: "one two three", "four five six", "seven eight", and "nine ten".

ANSWER: 4
