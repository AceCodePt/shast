# flex-grow-shares-remaining — opencode/minimax-m2.5

- arm: `resolved`
- probes: flex-grow dividing the free space
- expected: 400 — the free 600px is split 1:2, so `root>b` gets two thirds

## Question

`root` is `display: flex`. `root>a` has `flex: 1` and `root>b` has `flex: 2`. How wide is `root>b`?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 600x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root    div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=19.19
  = display: flex

root>a  div  "A"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=200 height=19.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), flex: 1

root>b  div  "B"
  @ x=200 y=0 width=400 height=19.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), flex: 2
```

## Model reply

`root` is 600px wide and uses flex layout. With `flex: 1` on `root>a` and `flex: 2` on `root>b`, the free space is split in a 1:2 ratio. `root>b` gets 2/(1+2) = 2/3 of 600px = 400px, which matches the rendered box.

ANSWER: 400
