## Question

Can a person reading this page in a browser read the whole sentence in `root>lede`?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root         div
root>lede    p    "The quarterly results are in and every region beat its targ…" (72 chars)
root>body    p    "Details follow in the table below."
root>banner  div

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

The screenshot clearly shows that a dark banner at the top of the viewport completely occludes the lede paragraph (`root>lede`). Therefore, the text is hidden and cannot be read by a user viewing the page.

ANSWER: NO
