- probes: naming the block to edit, having been told the obvious edit failed
- expected: root>body — its `> panel` block is (0,2,0) against the panel's own (0,1,0), so the panel's own declaration can never win and the 4px has to be changed where it is written

## Question

You want `root>body>panel` to render with 32px of padding. Which node's css block do you have to edit to get it?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x300

root             div
root>body        div
root>body>panel  section  "Panel"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.

The evidence above is the page exactly as it stands. Consider that `padding: 32px` has already been added to `root>body>panel`'s own css block — it is there in the source — and the rendering did not change. You are not shown a rendering of the outcome — work it out from the evidence.
```

## Model reply

Since adding `padding: 32px` directly to `root>body>panel`'s CSS block produced no visual change due to a conflicting rule shadowing it from the parent container, the shadowing rule residing in the parent must be adjusted. Therefore, you need to edit the CSS block of `root>body`.

ANSWER: root>body
