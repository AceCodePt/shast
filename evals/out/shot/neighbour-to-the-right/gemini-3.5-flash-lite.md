## Question

The four boxes form a two-by-two arrangement. Which node sits directly to the right of `root>leftBottom`, on the same row?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 800x400

root              div
root>leftTop      div  "left top"
root>rightTop     div  "right top"
root>leftBottom   div  "left bottom"
root>rightBottom  div  "right bottom"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 800x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

Based on the node tree and rendered screenshot, the two-by-two arrangement places `root>leftBottom` ("left bottom") on the bottom-left of the viewport. Directly to its right on the same row is `root>rightBottom` ("right bottom").

ANSWER: root>rightBottom
