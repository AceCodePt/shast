# dead-hover — opencode/gemini-3.5-flash-lite

- arm: `shot`
- probes: a `:hover` block that is overruled, which is invisible unless it is reported
- expected: NO — the root's `> mid > leaf` block outranks the :hover, so the hover declaration is dead
- parsed answer: `NO`
- verdict: **PASS**

## Question

`root>mid>leaf` has a `:hover` block setting `padding: 40px`. Does hovering over it change its padding?

## Context shown to the model

![rest.png](rest.png)
![hover.png](hover.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root           div
root>mid       div
root>mid>leaf  div  "Leaf"

Two screenshots of the rendered page are attached, both 500x300 CSS px at 1 device pixel per CSS px: first the page at rest, then the page while the mouse hovers `root>mid>leaf`. Compare them.
```

## Model reply

Comparing the two screenshots (`rest.png` and `hover.png`), the rendered text "Leaf" remains in the exact same position and state without any layout shift or visual change between the rest state and the hover state. This indicates that the `:hover` pseudo-class rule does not alter its padding or affect the rendering.

ANSWER: NO
