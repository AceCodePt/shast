## Question

`root` is `display: flex` with `gap: 10px`, containing two 100px-wide children. At what x does `root>second`'s left edge render?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root         div
root>first   div  "first"
root>second  div  "second"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.

## Model reply

`root` is a flex container starting at x = 0. The first child (`root>first`) has a width of 100px, taking up the region from x = 0 to x = 100. With a flex `gap: 10px`, the second child (`root>second`) is placed immediately after the first child plus the gap offset.

ANSWER: 110
