# repair-dead-hover — opencode/gpt-5.4-nano

- arm: `dom`
- probes: naming the block that is killing a state, not the state's own block
- expected: root — its `> mid > leaf` block is (0,3,0) and outranks the leaf's own `:hover` at (0,2,0), so the hover is dead until the root's block changes
- parsed answer: `root>mid`

## Question

You want `root>mid>leaf` to grow to 40px of padding on hover. Which node's css block do you have to edit to get it?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root           div
root>mid       div
root>mid>leaf  div  "Leaf"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid>leaf <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

Then the same data again while the mouse hovers `root>mid>leaf` — compare the two for what the `:hover` state changes:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>mid>leaf <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=23.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 2px 2px 2px 2px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

The evidence above is the page exactly as it stands. Consider that `:hover { padding: 40px }` has already been added to `root>mid>leaf`'s own css block — it is there in the source — and hovering changes nothing. You are not shown a rendering of the outcome — work it out from the evidence.
```

## Model reply

The hover attempt is in `root>mid>leaf`’s own CSS block, but Chromium’s `getComputedStyle()` shows the leaf’s computed `padding` stays at `2px` both before and during hover. That means the `:hover { padding: 40px }` rule from the leaf’s block is not winning (either not applied as expected, or overridden by a higher-priority rule coming from another node’s CSS). Since only the leaf’s padding would be affected and the leaf’s own hover change didn’t show up in computed styles, you need to edit the parent node’s CSS block that’s supplying/overriding the leaf’s padding rule.

ANSWER: root>mid
