## Question

Both `root>lower` and `root>sideways` sit outside the area first shown. Only one of them can be brought into view by ordinary scrolling. Which node can the viewer NOT reach that way?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root           div
root>lower     div  "further down"
root>sideways  div  "runs off sideways"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=900
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 900px
  left: 0px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: relative
  top: 0px
  width: 500px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>lower <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=700 width=400 height=40
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px

  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>sideways <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=40 width=900 height=40
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block

## Model reply

Looking at the viewport and the positioning of these elements:

The viewport is 500x300 (width × height). The root div is 500x900, so vertical scrolling is possible. Let me analyze each element:

**root>lower**: positioned at y=700 with height=40, so it spans from y=700 to y=740. Since the root container is 900px tall and the viewport is 300px tall, you can scroll down to bring this element into view (scrolling to y=700 would show it at the bottom of the viewport).

**root>sideways**: positioned at y=40 with width=900 and height=40. It spans from y=40 to y=80 vertically, which is within the scrollable range. However, it's 900px wide in a 500px wide viewport. Horizontal scrolling isn't mentioned as an option ("ordinary scrolling" typically means vertical scrolling on a vertically-scrollable page), and the root element has `overflow: visible` rather than `overflow: auto` or `overflow: scroll`, so the element extends beyond the viewport width with no horizontal scrollbar available.

Since only vertical scrolling is available through ordinary means, the sideways element cannot be fully brought into view due to its horizontal overflow.

ANSWER: root>sideways
