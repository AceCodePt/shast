## Question

What is the background colour of `root>cta` when the page is first painted and the pointer is elsewhere?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 400x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root      div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=43.19

root>cta  div  "Continue"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=43.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), background-color: #3355ff, padding: 12px
  :hover  background-color: #0022cc
```

## Model reply

The report shows that `root>cta` has a default `background-color: #3355ff` and a separate `:hover` state with `background-color: #0022cc`. When the page is first painted and the pointer is elsewhere (not hovering over the element), the default background color applies, not the hover state.

ANSWER: #3355ff
