## Question

Both `root>lower` and `root>sideways` sit outside the area first shown. Only one of them can be brought into view by ordinary scrolling. Which node can the viewer NOT reach that way?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x300

root           div
root>lower     div  "further down"
root>sideways  div  "runs off sideways"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=500 height=900
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 900px
  left: 0px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: relative
  top: 0px
  width: 500px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>lower <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=700 width=400 height=40
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px

  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>sideways <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=40 width=900 height=40
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px

## Model reply

The `root` element has a width of 500px and a height of 900px, while the viewport is 500px wide and 300px high. Because the `root` element's height (900px) exceeds the viewport height (300px), the browser will provide vertical scrolling, allowing the viewer to scroll down to reach the `root>lower` node, which is located at `y=700`.

However, the `root` element's width (500px) exactly matches the viewport width. The `root>sideways` node, although 900px wide, is absolutely positioned and does not expand the width of its parent (`root`). Since the `root` container remains 500px wide and has `overflow: visible`, the extra width of the child node simply spills out to the right without triggering a horizontal scrollbar. Therefore, the viewer can scroll down to see `root>lower`, but they cannot scroll sideways to see the full extent of `root>sideways`.

REASONING: The vertical height of the content (900px) exceeds the viewport height (300px), creating a vertical scrollbar that makes `root>lower` reachable. The horizontal width of the content (500px) does not exceed the viewport width (500px), so no horizontal scrollbar is created to reach the overflowing part of `root>sideways`.

ANSWER: root>sideways
