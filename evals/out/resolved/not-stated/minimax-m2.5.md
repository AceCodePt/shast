## Question

What text colour does `root>label` render with? If the report does not contain that information, say so rather than guessing.

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 400x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root        div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=35.19

root>label  div  "Total due"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=400 height=35.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), padding: 8px
```

## Model reply

The report lists resolved styles only for font-size and padding on `root>label`. There is no mention of a `color`, `text-color`, or any related property, and no colour is recorded for the rendered text. Since the report does not contain that information, I should not guess (the default browser text colour, typically black, is not stated here).

ANSWER: NOT STATED
