## Question

Which node's text is drawn on the same pixels as `root>ghost`'s text?

## Context shown to the model


```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root          div
root>ghost    div  "Important warning"
root>visible  div  "Everything is fine"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 19.1875px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 400px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>ghost <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=0 height=0
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 0px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 0px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>visible <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  height: 19.1875px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 400px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

## Model reply

Looking at the bounding rectangles provided:

- `root>ghost` has `getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=0 height=0` — it occupies zero pixels
- `root>visible` has `getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=19.1875` — it occupies the same space as the root

Since `root>ghost` has zero width and height, its text is not actually drawn on any pixels on screen. However, the question asks which node's text is drawn on the same pixels as `root>ghost`'s text would be if it were rendered.

Given that `root>ghost` has x=0, y=0 coordinates with zero dimensions, and `root>visible` also starts at x=0, y=0, the `root>visible` element occupies the space where `root>ghost`'s text would theoretically be positioned (at the origin).

ANSWER: root>visible
