# long-word-overflows — opencode/qwen3.5-plus

- arm: `shot+dom`
- probes: an unbreakable token wider than its box
- expected: NO — there is no break opportunity in the URL, so the single word runs to ~518px and is painted outside the box

## Question

Does the URL in `root>cell` stay inside `root>cell`'s 120px-wide box?

## Context shown to the model

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root       div
root>cell  div  "https://example.com/a/very/long/path/that/never/breaks"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=600 height=19.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 600px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>cell <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=120 height=19.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  width: 120px
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.

## Model reply

Looking at the data:

- `root>cell` has `width=120px` and `overflow: visible`
- The text content is "https://example.com/a/very/long/path/that/never/breaks"
- The screenshot shows the URL rendering across nearly the full 600px viewport width
- The parent `root` has `width=600px`

Since the text is visibly rendered extending far beyond the 120px boundary of `root>cell` (it would need roughly 400-500px to display that entire URL at 16px font), and `overflow: visible` allows content to render outside the box, the URL clearly overflows its container.

ANSWER: NO
