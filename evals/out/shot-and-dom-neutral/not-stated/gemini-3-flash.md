## Question

What text colour does `root>label` render with? If the report does not contain that information, say so rather than guessing.

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 400x300

root        div
root>label  div  "Total due"

Below is the browser's own data for each node — `getBoundingClientRect()` and `getComputedStyle()`:

root <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=35.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

root>label <div>
  getBoundingClientRect: x=0 y=0 width=400 height=35.1875
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
  color: rgb(0, 0, 0)
  display: block
  font-size: 16px
  line-height: 19.2px
  opacity: 1
  overflow: visible
  position: static
  z-index: auto
  padding: 8px 8px 8px 8px
  border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 400x300 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.

## Model reply

The browser's data for the node `root>label` explicitly lists its computed style properties. Under the `root>label <div>` section, the `color` property is recorded as `rgb(0, 0, 0)`. In CSS, the `color` property defines the color of the text within an element.

ANSWER: rgb(0, 0, 0)
