## Question

`root` is `display: flex`. `root>a` has `flex: 1` and `root>b` has `flex: 2`. How wide is `root>b`?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 600x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root    div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=19.19
  = display: flex

root>a  div  "A"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=200 height=19.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), flex: 1

root>b  div  "B"
  @ x=200 y=0 width=400 height=19.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), flex: 2
```

## Model reply

The root container has a total width of 600px and uses flex layout with two children having flex factors of 1 and 2, respectively (totaling 3). Item `root>b` receives 2/3 of the available width, which calculates to 400px, matching its rendered dimension.
