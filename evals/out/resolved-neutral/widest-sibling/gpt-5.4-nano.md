## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 900x400
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root        div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=900 height=300
  = position: relative, height: 300px

root>rail   nav      "rail"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=240 height=300
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 0px, left: 0px, width: 240px, height: 300px

root>panel  section  "panel"
  @ x=264 y=0 width=600 height=300
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), position: absolute, top: 0px, left: 264px, width: 600px, height: 300px
```

## Model reply

`root>panel` has width **600px**, while `root>rail` has width **240px**. The ratio is \(600 / 240 = 2.5\). Rounded to one decimal place, this is **2.5**.

ANSWER: 2.5
