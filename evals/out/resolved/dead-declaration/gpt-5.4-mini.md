# dead-declaration — opencode/gpt-5.4-mini

- arm: `resolved`
- probes: an own declaration that an ancestor overrides, i.e. a shadowed property
- expected: NO — the root's `> body > panel` block overrides it with 4px

## Question

`root>body>panel` has `padding: 32px` in its own css block. Does that declaration have any effect on the rendered page?

## Context shown to the model


```
viewport 600x300
@ = border box [x, y, width, height], in CSS px — x and y are absolute from the top-left of the page, already resolved, not relative to the parent

root             div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.19

root>body        div
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.19

root>body>panel  section  "Panel"
  @ x=0 y=0 width=600 height=27.19
  = font-size: 16px (inherited), padding: 4px, border-radius: 8px
  ← padding: 4px   declared by root, inside its "> body > panel" block   — shadows padding: 32px declared by root>body>panel itself, at the top of its css block
```

## Model reply

No. The rendered box shows `padding: 4px`, and the report explicitly says that value shadows the `padding: 32px` declared in `root>body>panel` itself. Since the resolved style already uses 4px, the 32px declaration does not affect the rendered page.

ANSWER: NO
