# partial-cover — opencode/gpt-5.4-mini

## Question

`root>chip` paints over part of `root>row`. Is any of `root>row`'s own text hidden by it?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 600x400

root       div
root>row   p    "Short label"
root>chip  div  "chip"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 600x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

No. The screenshot shows `root>row`’s text, `Short label`, fully visible at the top left, while `root>chip` sits separately to the right and does not cover any of those letters. There is overlap in the page layout area, but not over the row’s own text.

ANSWER: NO
