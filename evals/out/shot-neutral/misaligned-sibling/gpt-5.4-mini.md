## Question

Four rows are stacked down the page. Three of them share the same left edge and one does not. Which one is out of alignment?

## Context shown to the model

![page.png](page.png)

```
The node tree, one line per node — path, tag, and the text as written in the source. CSS can change how that text renders, so treat the evidence below as authoritative for what is actually on screen:

viewport 500x400

root         div
root>first   div  "first"
root>second  div  "second"
root>third   div  "third"
root>fourth  div  "fourth"

Attached is a screenshot of the rendered page at 500x400 CSS px, at 1 device pixel per CSS px.
```

## Model reply

`third` is the one shifted to the right. In the screenshot, `first`, `second`, and `fourth` share the same left margin, while `third` starts noticeably farther in, so it is the misaligned row.

ANSWER: root>third
